# 3D Pose Estimation Model

The pre-trained model and a significant portion of the inference code in this folder came from https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo which in turn was based on the [Lightweight OpenPose](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12004.pdf) and [Single-Shot Multi-Person 3D Pose Estimation From Monocular RGB](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.03453.pdf) papers

Most of my original work was performed in the AngleCalculator class.
